This repository contains all the projects for the ALX SE Low Level Programming course. We focused on studying the C Programming Language, and because of its low levelness, it exposed us to understanding the deeper working mechanisms of the computer.  The following are the projects we undertook in this course.
 0x00. C - Hello, World: an introduction to the basics of C
 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while: we studied conditions and decision making in c
 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops: our first encounter with functions and loops
 0x03. C - Debugging: we learnt to debug code written by another engineer or developer
 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings: we studied pointers
 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
